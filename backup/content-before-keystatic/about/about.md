I'm a full-stack developer with a passion for creating beautiful, functional, and user-friendly web applications. With experience in **modern frameworks and technologies**, I love turning ideas into reality through code. When I'm not coding, you can find me **exploring new technologies**, contributing to open source, or enjoying a good cup of coffee.
