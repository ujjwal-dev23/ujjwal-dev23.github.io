Currently a CS undergraduate at **NSUT**, I’ve spent my time outside the classroom diving into the niches of the field. While my projects range from full-stack web development to creating custom automation scripts, I have a particular fascination with emulation programming.

While I have the most experience working with `C/C++`, `Python`, and Web Technologies, but I like to explore any and all knowledge I can in this vast field.
